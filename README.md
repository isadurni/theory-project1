**Theory Team Project #1** - The Knapsack Problem

Team Members: Ignacio Sadurni, Michael Sorenson, Juan Rubero

**Problem.**
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem that involves selecting a combination of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit. A common variation of this is the Coin Change Problem, where the goal is to find the optimal combination of coins to make a target value using the fewest number of coins.

**Solution.**
In this specific problem, given a set of coins of different denominations, we aim to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given target amount. The challenge is to determine the best combination of coins that sums exactly to the target value, using brute force, pruning, and dynamic programming methods to explore and optimize possible solutions.
